##About Me:

I am a web developer. At the moment I am strengthening my knowledge, 
learning new technologies and looking job. I graduated from the 
Moscow Power Engineering Institute and worked as a design engineer for a 
long time. Since childhood, I liked use computer for every day 
(mostly playing games, of course), and I also study different programs, 
and make first steps to development (Fortran, Pascal). Finally,
I decided to change profession. In addition, working as a 
web developer goes well with my passion for traveling (I am visited lot countries 
like as Spain, India, Sweden, Thailand, Austria, Vietnam etc).
I have a little experience in the collective creation of a non-commercial
web-site project ([https://distsamgtu.ru](https://distsamgtu.ru)).
For this web-site I work as a developer and technical 
leader of the front-end development team. In the project We were able to learn
new technologies (Sass, Redux, Axios), share and learn the experience 
of other developers, gain teamwork skills and communication with another IT 
specialists (backend development, testers, product managers, designers).
